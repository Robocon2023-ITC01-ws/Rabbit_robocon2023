The dataset includes 1420 images.
Poles-object-detction are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -8 and +8 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -29 and +29 percent
